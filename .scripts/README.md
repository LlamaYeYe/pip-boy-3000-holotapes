| 08/29/2026 | Built out `types/` directory with initial type definitions generated from code.                                        | Fully reviewed and tested, but could use more notes from official API documenation I'm sure. |
| 09/05/2026 | Worked with AI to convert the JavaScript files to TypeScript.                                                          | This needs FULL testing by the developers.                                                   |
| 09/05/2026 | Continued with work on converting Holotape JS files to TS.                                                             | Reviewed and tested.                                                                         |
| 09/19/2026 | Used AI to help me build the build and verification scripts in `.scripts/`.                                            | Reviewed and tested.                                                                         |
| 09/19/2026 | Had AI help me update the `README.md` and `agents.md` files with all of my own personal notes and new project updates. | Reviewed and tested.                                                                         |

Personally reviewed and tested all AI-assisted changes, which were mostly
converting JS to TS files, and building scripts that test the code thoroughly.
