# agents.md

Instructions for LLM agents writing or reviewing holotapes in this repository.
Follow these rules strictly. A review fails on any violation of the mandatory
checks in section 7.

Human contributors: [README.md](README.md) is the short guide (setup, create,
build, contribute). This file holds the detailed TypeScript, device, and review
rules - including notes that used to live in the README.

## 1. Project context

- **Platform:** Pip-Boy 3000 replica running Espruino, a JavaScript interpreter
  for microcontrollers. Not the older Pip-Boy 3000 Mk V; some APIs differ.
- **Display:** 480x320, 4bpp. Color indices 0 (black) to 3 (white), with 1 and 2
  as intermediate greys.
- **Input:** two scroll wheels (`knob1`, `knob2`), each of which also presses.
- **Memory:** extremely constrained. Every variable allocation consumes a scarce
  block.
- **Language:** the Espruino subset. It has `class`, arrow functions, `Promise`,
  typed arrays, `Math.randInt`, `E.clip`, `E.defrag`. It does **not** have ES
  modules, `async`/`await`, or template literals.
- **Source language here is TypeScript.** The build strips types and emits the
  JavaScript the device runs. See section 3.
- **The API is documented in the types, not here.** `types/*.d.ts` carries JSDoc
  on every member of `Pip`, `h` (Graphics), `E`, `fs`, `Storage`, `player`,
  `DataFile`, and `InvFile`, including argument meanings, value ranges, and
  gotchas. Read the declaration rather than guessing, and never invent a method
  that is not declared.

## 2. Repository layout

Every holotape lives in its own directory:

```text
holotapes/<YourHolotape>/
  storage/          Required files, uppercase stems, lowercase extensions
    APP.ts          Main source
    TYPES.d.ts      Local types, when needed
  optional/         storageOptional files, when used
  previews/         Preview media, when used
  metadata.json     Registration entry (hand-written)
  README.md         Description, controls, credits
  ChangeLog         Version history
```

Rules:

- **Never add `.js`, `.min.js`, or `registry.json` under `holotapes/`.** They
  are generated only under `dist/pip-boy-3000-holotapes/`. `.min.js` is binary;
  formatting or editing it corrupts it. Regenerate with `npm run build`.
- **`metadata.json` is hand-maintained and nothing generates it.** No script in
  this repository writes a `metadata.json`, adds a `storage` entry, or invents
  an asset path. If a change needs a new file on the device, add its `storage`
  entry yourself and say so in your summary, because the developer is the only
  one who knows whether a file is required or optional and what it should be
  called on the device. The same applies to icons, `README.md`, and `ChangeLog`.
- Repository files under `storage/`, `optional/`, and `previews/` use uppercase
  filename stems and lowercase extensions. `storage/APP.ts` emits
  `storage/APP.JS` and `storage/APP.MIN.JS`. On-device paths remain fully
  uppercase to match the Pip-Boy development team's SD card convention.
- Every metadata `storage` `source` is directly under `storage/`, every
  `storageOptional` `source` is directly under `optional/`, and every preview is
  directly under `previews/`. The metadata icon is directly under `storage/` (no
  `assets/` folder).
- Every holotape has exactly one metadata icon: a transparent PNG or IMG that is
  exactly 120 by 120 pixels. Layout validation rejects anything else.
- Types used by one holotape go in that holotape's `TYPES.d.ts`. Only things the
  device itself provides belong in the shared `types/`.
- `ChangeLog` entries are:

  ```text
  <version> (<yyyy-mm-dd>)
  - <change description>
  ```

## 3. TypeScript rules

### 3.1 Only erasable syntax

`tsconfig.json` sets `erasableSyntaxOnly`. The build strips annotations and
changes nothing else: no transpiling, no downlevelling, no polyfills. Do not use
`enum`, a `namespace` with a runtime body, or constructor parameter properties.
Interfaces, type aliases, generics, and annotations are all fine.

### 3.2 No typechecking escapes

`@ts-nocheck`, bare `@ts-ignore`, unexplained `@ts-expect-error`, `any`, and
`unknown` are rejected by ESLint. Declare a concrete type (or a named interface
in a local `TYPES.d.ts`). Return types on functions are required and are
erasable.

### 3.3 Type syntax is free, code changes are not

This is the most important rule in the file.

Annotations, `as` casts, `!` non-null assertions, and `!:` definite assignment
assertions all erase to nothing, so they cannot change device behaviour. Adding
an initializer, a guard, or a temporary variable **does** change it, even when
it looks equivalent:

```ts
// Free: erases to `let winner;`
let winner!: string | null;

// Not free: emits `let winner = null;`
let winner: string | null = null;
```

When satisfying the type checker on code that already works on hardware, reach
for the erasable form first. If a real code change is genuinely the right fix,
make it deliberately, say so, and flag that it needs a device retest.

Useful erasable idioms:

- `let x!: T;` definite assignment when the value is filled before use and you
  do not want an initializer in the emitted JS.
- `x = null as never;` (or a typed sentinel) for teardown that clears a value.
- `function F(this: Shape, ...)` types a constructor-style function. Prefer a
  named constructor type over casting through `any`/`unknown`.

### 3.4 Never use `any` or `unknown`

Both are banned under `holotapes/**` and the linter enforces it. Declare a
concrete type or a named interface in a local `TYPES.d.ts`. For eval'd scene
factories, cast to a named factory type - do not leave the value as `unknown`.

### 3.5 Type the shapes, not just the leaves

Give a holotape's records real interfaces in its `types.d.ts`, with a JSDoc line
on every member explaining what it holds. A game's piece, its player record, its
save file, and its scene contract are all worth naming. Prefer that over
inlining an anonymous object type at each use.

### 3.6 Write annotations yourself

Write return types, parameter types, and named shapes by hand. Do not leave them
for inference or for a helper script. Object shapes built up property by
property, state variables filled in by a later `reset()`, and parameters with no
obvious call site still need judgement. Prefer a concrete annotation over
loosening a type to silence an error.

### 3.7 Build and verify

```bash
npm run verify
```

Layout, typecheck, lint, format check, metadata schema, production build, and
dist file checks. Run it before claiming a change is done, and report the result
honestly. `npm run build` alone emits `.js`, `.min.js`, and the registry under
`dist/pip-boy-3000-holotapes/` (registry is part of build, not a separate npm
script). Generated output must never be committed.

If the registry step reports a metadata problem, do not attempt to repair the
`metadata.json` on the developer's behalf unless they asked for it. Report which
file it named and what it said.

-

## 4. App structure

### 4.1 Function expression, not invoked

The whole app is an anonymous function expression. The Pip-Boy OS evaluates the
file and calls it. Do **not** add a trailing `()`.

```ts
(function (): HolotapeApp {
  // App code
});
```

### 4.2 Return object

The function must return an object with at least `id` and `remove`:

| Field        | Type       | Required | Description                                  |
| ------------ | ---------- | -------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| `id`         | `string`   | Yes      | Uppercase alphanumeric, no spaces or hyphens |
| `remove`     | `function` | Yes      | Cleanup, see 4.3                             |
| `notDefault` | `boolean`  | No       | Pressing any mode button exits the app       |
| `fullscreen` | `boolean`  | No       | Hides the OS header and footer               |

Put the id string literally in the return object; do not spend a variable on an
`APP_ID` constant.

### 4.3 `remove()` must tear down everything

Everything the app created, or it leaks into the OS and the next app:

1. Every `Pip.on` / `Pip.onExclusive` listener, via `Pip.removeListener`.
2. Every `setInterval` / `setTimeout` handle.
3. Every `setWatch` handle, via `clearWatch`.
4. `Pip.audioStop()` if the app played audio, `Pip.videoStop()` if it played
   video.
5. `h.clear()` if the app drew over non-app screen content.
6. Any setting the app changed (brightness, volume, palette, blit options),
   restored to the value captured on load.

It does not need a double-removal guard.

`remove()` must **never** call `load()` or `E.reboot()`. The app exits cleanly
so the OS can restore what was there before.

### 4.4 Declaration order

**Espruino does not hoist function declarations.** Statements run in source
order and a `function name() {}` only exists once its line has executed.
Referencing it earlier, including passing it to `setInterval`, `setTimeout`,
`Pip.on`, `Pip.onExclusive`, or `setWatch`, throws `ReferenceError` on the
device.

Declare all functions first, then initialization last: state, functions,
listener registration, first draw, timers, return object.

Node and browsers do hoist, so this bug is invisible to any off-device check.
The exception is a reference inside a callback body that runs later; by then the
whole file has finished executing.

### 4.5 Lazy scene loading

To keep RAM small, split rarely-active screens into separate files loaded from
the SD card only while in use. Each is a function expression, like an app:

```ts
(function (app: MyApp, params?: MySceneParams): MyScene {
  return { remove: removeScene };
});
```

The parent loads, uses, and drops it:

```ts
const scene = (eval(fs.readFileSync('HOLO/MYAPP/SCENE.JS')) as MySceneFactory)(
  app,
  params,
);
// later:
scene.remove();
process.memory(true); // force GC to reclaim the code
```

Rules:

- Type the factory (`MySceneFactory`) and cast the `eval` result to it. Never
  use `any` or `unknown`.
- The scene registers its own `Pip.onExclusive` handlers, displacing the
  parent's; the parent re-registers on unload.
- Pass state and write-back callbacks through the shared app object.
- The parent gates its own draws while a scene is loaded, so background events
  do not paint over the child screen.
- Every extra file needs its own `storage` entry in `metadata.json`, or loading
  fails with `NO_FILE`.

-

## 5. Device programming rules

### 5.1 Variables and memory

- `const` for constants, `let` for mutable state. **Never `var`** in new code.
- **Espruino does not block-scope `let`/`const`.** A `for (let i ...)` loop
  variable leaks to function scope. Never reuse a name inside a block if the
  outer value is still needed after it.
- Minimize declarations. Every one costs a scarce block. Hardcode constants that
  never change and inline single-use values.
- Group related constants into one object (`const C = { ... }`) rather than many
  individual declarations.
- Never alias the global `h`. Use it directly.
- Dense numeric data belongs in typed arrays, which are contiguous and far
  faster for random access than Espruino's linked-list arrays.

### 5.2 Graphics

- Chain calls on `h`:
  `h.setColor(3).setFontMonofonto16().setFontAlign(0, 0).drawString(...)`.
- **`h.setColor()` persists globally**, across statements and function
  boundaries. Set it explicitly before any draw where the color matters.
- Minimize pixels written per frame. Use `h.clearRect()`, `h.setClipRect()`, and
  dirty flags so only changed regions redraw.
- Cache wrapped text. `h.wrapString()` is expensive; wrap once and store the
  lines and their height.
- Interval-driven apps rely on the OS auto-flush every 50ms. Do **not** add
  manual `h.flip()` calls to a `setInterval` loop; they fire at arbitrary times
  relative to scanout and cause tearing. For `Pip.onFrame`-style rendering, set
  `Pip.lastFlip = getTime()` before drawing and call `h.flip()` after.
- `Pip.blitOptions.y1` / `.y2` blit only a band of rows, a large win for
  scrolling lists. `delete` both afterwards to restore full-screen updates.
- Prefer one `h.drawImage()` over many `fillRect`/`drawLine` calls for a sprite.

### 5.3 Input

- `Pip.onExclusive('knob1', handler)` is the default: it displaces any other
  listener so the app is the sole handler. Use `Pip.on` only when handlers must
  coexist.
- The handler receives a direction: `1` down/clockwise, `-1` up/counter-
  clockwise, `0` a press. A press may pass `true` as a second argument for a
  long press.
- `setWatch` on `ENC1_PRESS` is for unusually latency-sensitive presses only. A
  direct watch on a button such as `BTN_DATA` is appropriate only because no
  `Pip.on` event exists for it.
- An empty knob handler is legitimate: registering one claims the exclusive slot
  for a wheel the app deliberately ignores.

### 5.4 Timing and directives

- Drive animation with `setInterval` at the target frame rate, commonly 50ms.
  `requestAnimationFrame` does not exist.
- `"ram"` as the first statement of a function runs it from RAM instead of
  flash, and pretokenises it. Use it for the main frame loop.
- `"jit"` compiles a function to native ARM. Use it for small, self-contained,
  math-heavy loops. One directive per function.
- Do not add either without a measured need. The linter is configured not to
  strip them; the minifier preserves them.
- Whitespace and comments inside hot loops cost time on every iteration, since
  Espruino executes from source.

### 5.5 Files, assets, and audio

- `fs` is a global; `require("fs")` is optional. Paths take no leading slash:
  `fs.readFileSync("HOLO/MYAPP/DATA.JSON")`.
- **`fs.statSync()` returns `undefined` for a missing path, it does not throw.**
  A `try`/`catch` around it never fires. Check the return value.
- `fs.mkdir()` does not create parent directories; walk and create each level.
- Defer heavy asset loading with `setTimeout(fn, 0)` so the app returns its
  object first, and call `E.defrag()` before large allocations. Clear that
  timeout in `remove()`.
- Stream large images into `h.buffer` with `E.openFile()` rather than holding a
  second full copy in memory.
- Images must be 4bpp or less, converted with the
  [Image Converter](https://www.pip-boy.com/tools/image-converter).
- `Pip.audioStart()` stops any current playback already; a preceding
  `Pip.audioStop()` is redundant.
- Audio is 16kHz mono WAV, PCM or ADPCM. Video is MS RLE AVI only; an mpeg4 AVI
  will not decode.

### 5.6 Settings the app changes

If the app changes brightness or volume, capture the live values on load
(`Pip.brightness` for brightness, `Pip.settings.volume` for volume) and restore
them in `remove()`, so in-app changes are session-only.

Note the scale trap: `Pip.settings.brightness` is the firmware UI's integer 1-20
scale, **not** the 0-1 float that `Pip.setBrightness()` takes. Never feed one
into the other. `Pip.settings.volume` is 3-27 and is directly compatible with
`Pip.setVol()`.

-

## 6. Registration and metadata

`metadata.json` is written and maintained by the developer. Treat it as input
you read, not output you produce. Do not create one, do not add or reorder
`storage` entries, and do not rewrite asset paths, unless the developer asks for
that specifically. When your change adds a file the device needs, say plainly in
your summary which `storage` entry has to be added and what it should look like,
and leave the edit to them.

The one piece of automation here is the artifact's `holotapes/registry.json`,
which is generated by reading every `metadata.json`. That file never exists in
the source tree.

```json
{
  "id": "myholotape",
  "name": "My Holotape Name",
  "author": "@your-username",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "A brief description of the holotape.",
  "icon": "storage/ICON.png",
  "previews": ["previews/SCREEN.png"],
  "type": "game",
  "readme": "README.md",
  "storage": [{ "pipboy": "HOLO/MYAPP/APP.JS", "source": "storage/APP.ts" }],
  "storageOptional": []
}
```

| Field             | Rules                                                                                                      |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `id`              | Lowercase alphanumeric and hyphens only. Unique in the registry.                                           |
| `name`            | Human-readable name shown on pip-boy.com.                                                                  |
| `author`          | GitHub username(s) prefixed with `@`, space separated.                                                     |
| `version`         | [Semver](https://semver.org).                                                                              |
| `description`     | One sentence.                                                                                              |
| `icon`            | Transparent 120x120 PNG/IMG directly under `storage/`.                                                     |
| `previews`        | PNG, MP4, or GIF files directly under `previews/`.                                                         |
| `type`            | Exactly `app` or `game`. Nothing else.                                                                     |
| `readme`          | Usually `README.md`.                                                                                       |
| `storage`         | `{ pipboy, source }` pairs. `pipboy` is the on-device path; `source` is the repo file (`.ts` for scripts). |
| `storageOptional` | Same shape, for files the user can choose to install.                                                      |

`pipboy` paths follow `HOLO/<APP_ID>/<FILENAME>`, where `<APP_ID>` is the
metadata `id` uppercased with underscores replacing hyphens. That prefix is a
filesystem convention only; it has no relationship to any variable in the code.
Script `source` entries use uppercase stems and lowercase extensions (e.g.
`storage/APP.ts`). The build emits `APP.JS` / `APP.MIN.JS` and rewrites
production metadata/registry `source` values to the `.MIN.JS` artifact; `pipboy`
stays the on-device `.JS` name. Uppercase filenames match the Pip-Boy
development team's on-device convention.

## 7. Review and audit

When reviewing a change, check every mandatory item and report failures by rule
ID.

### 7.1 Mandatory

| R17 | Every file the app loads at runtime has a `storage` entry, or it fails with `NO_FILE`.                                                               |
| R18 | `README.md` documents the controls; `ChangeLog` has an entry for the change.                                                                         |
| R19 | `npm run verify` passes and no generated `.js`, `.min.js`, or registry is committed.                                                                 |
| R20 | Files under `storage/`, `optional/`, and `previews/` use uppercase stems and lowercase extensions. TypeScript lives under `storage/` or `optional/`. |
| R21 | Every `storage` `source` is directly under `storage/`.                                                                                               |
| R22 | Every `storageOptional` `source` is directly under `optional/`.                                                                                      |
| R23 | Every preview is directly under `previews/`; the metadata icon is directly under `storage/`.                                                         |
| R24 | The icon is a transparent PNG or IMG and exactly 120x120 pixels.                                                                                     |

| S01 | Dirty flags or clip rects limit redraw to changed regions.                 |
| S02 | `"ram"` on the frame loop, `"jit"` on tight numeric loops, where measured. |
| S03 | Heavy asset loading deferred with `setTimeout(fn, 0)`.                     |
| S04 | `E.defrag()` before large allocations.                                     |
| S05 | Single-use values inlined; constants grouped into one object.              |
| S06 | The app opens, closes, and reopens without leaking or crashing.            |
| S07 | Record types are named and documented in the holotape's `types.d.ts`.      |
| S08 | Images are 4bpp or less and converted, not raw.                            |

### 7.3 Verdict format

```markdown
## Holotape Review: `<Name>`

### Mandatory

- [x] R01 - function expression, not invoked
- [ ] R04 - `frameInterval` is never cleared in `remove()`

### Recommended

- [x] S01 - dirty flags used
- [ ] S05 - `W`/`H` recomputed each frame

### Verdict: FAIL - 1 mandatory check failed.
```

### 7.4 What a review cannot conclude

Static review does not prove an app works. Espruino's lack of hoisting and its
flat `let` scoping mean a file can read correctly and still fail on hardware.
Say so: recommend a device test rather than implying the change is verified.

## 8. Anti-patterns

Never generate these.

| Anti-pattern                                  | Why                                                             |
| --------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `any` / `unknown`                             | Banned under `holotapes/**`. Use concrete types.                |
| `enum`, runtime `namespace`, param properties | Not erasable; the build rejects them.                           |
| Adding or editing `.js` or `.min.js`          | Generated artifact files; `.min.js` is binary and will corrupt. |
| Adding or editing `registry.json`             | Generated only in the production artifact.                      |
| Writing or "fixing" `metadata.json` unasked   | Developer-owned. Report what needs adding instead.              |
| `async`/`await`, `import`/`export`            | Not available in Espruino.                                      |
| Template literals                             | Not supported.                                                  |
| `fetch()`, `XMLHttpRequest`                   | No network on the device.                                       |
| `requestAnimationFrame`                       | Not available. Use `setInterval`.                               |
| `Math.random()`                               | Use `Math.randInt(n)`.                                          |
| `var`                                         | Wastes blocks and is less clear than `const`/`let`.             |
| Referencing a function before its declaration | Espruino does not hoist; throws on device.                      |
| Reusing a `let` name a block still needs      | Espruino's `let` is function-scoped; the inner write clobbers.  |
| `load()` or `E.reboot()` in `remove()`        | Rebooting on exit is hostile. Exit cleanly.                     |
| `Pip.remove()` at the top of an app           | The OS already cleaned up the previous app.                     |
| Bare `clearWatch()`                           | Clears the OS's watches too. Always pass the id.                |
| `let c = h`                                   | Wastes a variable block. Use `h` directly.                      |
| `Pip.audioStop()` before `Pip.audioStart()`   | `audioStart` already stops current playback.                    |
| A function wrapping a single call             | Wastes a block. Inline it unless it adds real logic.            |
| `try`/`catch` that only calls `Pip.errorBox`  | The global handler already shows an error box.                  |
| Manual `h.flip()` inside a `setInterval` loop | Causes tearing. Rely on the OS auto-flush.                      |
| Globals outside the app's function            | Pollutes the namespace every holotape shares.                   |
| Storing many functions in arrays or objects   | Consumes excessive memory blocks.                               |
| Object or array nesting deeper than 4 levels  | Wastes blocks and slows access.                                 |
| Strings longer than ~256 characters           | Each consumes a variable block.                                 |
| Images above 4bpp, or unconverted             | Wastes storage and memory.                                      |
| Files outside their metadata layout directory | Rejected by the layout step in `npm run verify`.                |

## 9. Tooling notes

Notes that are too detailed for the README.

### 9.1 npm scripts

Day-to-day scripts in `package.json`:

- `npm install` - dependencies
- `npm run build` - `.scripts/build.ts` (helpers under `.scripts/build/`)
- `npm run verify` - `.scripts/verify.ts` (husky pre-commit + CI)
- `npm run format` - Prettier write
- `npm prepare` - husky install

Build helpers live under `.scripts/build/`. Verification steps live under
`.scripts/verify/`. Do not re-add one-off npm scripts for those steps without a
strong reason.

### 9.2 What the build emits

Under `dist/pip-boy-3000-holotapes/`:

- `APP.JS` - type-stripped, readable
- `APP.MIN.JS` - Terser + Espruino pretokenise (binary; never hand-edit)
- `holotapes/registry.json` - generated from every `metadata.json`

Script `metadata` `source` values point at `.ts` in the repo. The production
artifact rewrites those `source` paths to `.MIN.JS`. `pipboy` stays the
on-device `.JS` path.

### 9.3 CI

- **Validate** (`.github/workflows/validate.yml`): PRs into `main`. Runs
  `npm run verify`, rejects committed `.js` / `registry.json` under
  `holotapes/`, uploads a short-lived zip artifact.
- **Deploy** (`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`): push to `main`. Same verify, then
  publishes one permanent zip on the rolling GitHub Release tag `production`.

### 9.4 Troubleshooting

- **Build: unsupported TypeScript syntax** - erasable-only: no `enum`, no
  runtime `namespace`, no constructor parameter properties.
- **`ReferenceError` on device, fine elsewhere** - function used before its
  declaration line. Init last.
- **Works once, breaks on reopen** - incomplete `remove()`.
- **Typecheck fails on hardware-proven code** - prefer erasable fixes (`!:`,
  `as`, annotations) over runtime changes.
